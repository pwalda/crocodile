# Security model

## What we protect

| Asset                            | Who can read it                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Voice                            | Only the members of the call.                                                                 |
| Text messages (channels and DMs) | Only the members of the space or DM, now and later (via peer-to-peer history sync).           |
| Your identity key                | Only your linked devices (encrypted with the OS keychain) and whoever holds the recovery key. |

## What servers see

Coordination servers see **metadata**: public profiles, space names, channel
lists, memberships, device names, who is online, who is in which voice room,
and when people connect. They do **not** see whom you list as a friend or
block: each person's list is encrypted so that only their own devices can
read it, and friend requests and their answers travel as notes sealed to the
recipient's devices, with the sender's identity inside the encryption. A
server sees that someone sent a note to a user, when, and its size. The
server you are connected to does see whose presence you follow, whom you
send a friend request or answer to, and whom you start a direct message or
call with, while you do; it doesn't record who sent a note, and nothing of
that is replicated to other servers or kept after you disconnect. Blocks are
enforced by your own apps. They pass on signalling (SDP and
ICE candidates), which includes IP addresses. They never receive message or
voice content, except that a user who turned on the **opt-in relay** sends
their already end-to-end encrypted media through one; that server then also
sees packet sizes and timing, for at most an hour at a time. Users who turn
on the **mailbox** let their server hold direct messages for offline friends
as boxes sealed to the friend's devices; the server sees sender, recipient,
size and time, keeps them at most 7 days, and cannot read them.

**Deleting an account** (Settings → Profile) deletes the spaces the user
owns, leaves the others, and replaces the profile with a signed "deleted"
marker. Every server that receives the marker erases the account's devices,
friends list, memberships, notes and mailbox items, signs out its devices and
refuses anything the identity signs afterwards, so stale copies elsewhere in
the mesh can't bring it back. The marker itself stays: the user id, the
public keys and the words "Deleted user". Messages already delivered to other
people's devices stay there.

Connections to coordination servers and between servers are encrypted with
a per-connection hybrid key exchange (X25519 + ML-KEM-768) and AES-256-GCM,
independent of TLS, so metadata is not exposed to the network even when a
home-hosted server uses plain `ws://`.

The directory only sees coordination servers. Its public listing shows each
server's address obfuscated rather than in plain text (decodable by the app,
so not secret) and apps verify each entry's signature before using it.

The **host peer** of a session sees the IP addresses of its members and the
size and timing of their encrypted frames, plus who is speaking (from the
RFC 6464 audio-level header). It holds the same keys as every other member
(it is one), but its relay component only forwards ciphertext.

## Adversaries

| Adversary                          | Can                                                                                    | Cannot                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Network observer                   | See that you talk to certain IPs, and traffic volume.                                  | Read content or metadata (WebRTC DTLS plus E2E; encrypted server channels). Infer speech from packet sizes (constant-bitrate Opus).                                          |
| Harvest-now, decrypt-later         | Record traffic today.                                                                  | Decrypt it with a future quantum computer: every key exchange is hybrid with ML-KEM-768.                                                                                     |
| Malicious coordination server      | Lie about presence, drop or delay signalling, refuse service, log metadata.            | Forge profiles, spaces, invites, memberships or devices (all signed); substitute a user's key (user ids are key hashes); MITM WebRTC (SDP is identity-signed); read content. |
| Malicious mesh peer server         | Same as above.                                                                         | Same as above; clients re-verify every record.                                                                                                                               |
| Mailbox operator (opt-in mailbox)  | See who left how many messages for whom, and when; drop them.                          | Read, alter or forge them (sealed to the recipient's device, signed by the sender).                                                                                          |
| Relay operator (opt-in relay)      | See relayed packet sizes and timing for up to an hour.                                 | Read or alter content.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Non-member who learns a session id | Nothing: members only share keys with devices whose membership they verify themselves. |                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Former member                      | Keep what they already saw.                                                            | Decrypt anything after they left: sender keys are replaced on leave.                                                                                                         |
| Someone who steals a key later     | Decrypt at most the current 30-minute key period of a session.                         | Decrypt earlier messages (hash ratchets, deleted prekeys) or later ones (periodic fresh keys).                                                                               |
| Removed device                     | Keep what it already had.                                                              | Receive new keys or messages. (It still knows the account seed; see below.)                                                                                                  |
| Stolen, unlocked device            | Everything on it.

## Cryptography

- Ed25519 signatures, X25519 and ML-KEM-768 (`@noble/curves`,
  `@noble/post-quantum`), HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM (`@noble/hashes`,
  `@noble/ciphers`). All audited, pure-TypeScript implementations.
- Sealed boxes to a device: X25519 and ML-KEM-768 against the device's
  current prekey (rotated weekly, secret deleted after a grace period), HKDF,
  AES-GCM; signed by the sender and bound to sender and recipient devices.
- Sender keys with a per-message text ratchet and a 30-second audio ratchet,
  replaced every 30 minutes and on leave.
- Voice: per-frame AES-GCM with an authenticated SFrame-style trailer
  `(kid, generation, counter)`; constant-bitrate Opus.
- Text: author-signed, Padmé-padded, encrypted with the text chain.
- Device linking: short one-time code plus a 6-digit security code compared
  on both screens, then a hybrid-encrypted, signed transfer.
- Every signature is domain-separated (`SIG_DOMAIN` in `protocol/constants.ts`).
- Local data (identity, prekeys, history) is encrypted at rest with a key
  kept in the OS keychain (Electron `safeStorage`).

## Known gaps

- Linked devices share the account seed; per-device signing keys certified by
  the identity (so a removed device can no longer sign) are planned.
- Sender keys rather than MLS: good forward secrecy and 30-minute healing,
  but rekeying cost grows with group size.
- Safety-number verification is manual.
- The host peer and relay operators see traffic metadata (sizes, timing,
  speaking activity).
