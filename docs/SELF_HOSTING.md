# Running a coordination server

Coordination servers are the volunteer backbone of Crocodile. They store
signed records, keep track of who is online, relay WebRTC signalling and
elect session hosts. **They can't read voice or messages:** those are
end-to-end encrypted and normally go directly between people, through a
server only with the opt-in mailbox or relay. A small VPS (1 vCPU, 512 MB)
handles thousands of users.

## From the desktop app

Settings → **Host a Server** → _Run a coordination server_. For internet
use, forward TCP+UDP port 7443 and UDP port 7444 on your router to your computer, then enter
your public address (e.g. `http://203.0.113.7:7443`). Enable _List in the
server directory_ to let others use it. Without a public address it serves
your local network. Either way it joins the network and keeps a copy of its
account records; see [If other people use your server](#if-other-people-use-your-server).

## With Docker

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pwalda/crocodile && cd crocodile
CROC_NAME="Swamp EU-1" \
CROC_PUBLIC_URL=https://croc.example.org \
CROC_DIRECTORY=https://directory.example.org \
CROC_REGION=eu-west \
docker compose up -d coordinator
```

Expose **TCP 7443** (HTTP + WebSocket), **UDP 7443** (STUN and relay) and
**UDP 7444** (a second STUN port: apps compare the two to detect their NAT
type without asking third-party STUN servers). For HTTPS,
put any reverse proxy in front of TCP 7443 with WebSocket upgrades enabled,
and set `CROC_PUBLIC_URL` to the https URL. Keep the UDP ports open directly.

## Without Docker

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm --filter @crocodile/coordinator build
node packages/coordinator/dist/bin.js --help
```

### The opt-in mailbox

Users who opt in can leave direct messages for friends who are offline. Your
server stores them as boxes sealed to the recipient's devices (it cannot read
them) until the recipient connects anywhere in the mesh or `--mailbox-days`
pass. Quotas per sender and recipient keep storage bounded (a few MB per
thousand messages). Turn it off with `--mailbox off`.

### The opt-in relay

Some users sit behind networks that block direct connections. If they turn
on "Relay through a coordination server", your server can relay their
already end-to-end encrypted media over the STUN UDP port (TURN). Each
grant lasts at most one hour, `--relay-max-users` caps how many people use
it at once, and each allocation is rate-limited (about 100 kbit/s of voice
per person). Your server only ever sees ciphertext. Turn it off with
`--relay off` if bandwidth is scarce. The desktop app's built-in server
leaves it off unless you enable "Offer a relay".

## Hosting safely

**Why port 7443?** It's an unprivileged port (no administrator rights needed
to open it), it reads as "an alternative HTTPS port" to firewalls and
people, and one number serves both TCP (HTTP/WebSocket) and UDP (STUN and the
relay), so there is only one port to forward. Any port works (`--port`); the
main server puts the TCP side behind a reverse proxy on 443.

**What sharing your server's address exposes:**

- **Your public IP address.** It reveals your approximate location and
  internet provider, and makes you a target for denial-of-service attacks
  (someone flooding your connection). If you list the server in the
  directory, the listing shows the address only in an obfuscated form (see
  below), but anyone running the app can still decode it. Calls already expose IP addresses
  between the people in them (that is how peer-to-peer works), but a server
  address is shared with everyone who connects.
- **A program listening on the internet.** Any bug in it could be attacked.
  The server validates every message, limits sizes and rates, caps
  connections per address (`--max-connections-per-ip`) and in total
  (`--capacity`), and times out connections that don't authenticate. Each
  account can make it store at most 100 devices, 100 spaces and 500
  memberships, and each space at most 1000 invites, so one account cannot
  fill your disk (records replicated from other servers are not counted). The
  built-in relay refuses to send traffic to your own machine or your private
  network (loopback, 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, link-local, CGNAT, IPv6
  ULA and similar), so relay users cannot reach your router or other home
  devices through it.
- **Metadata of the people using it, and a copy of everyone's records.**
  Your server sees who is online and who talks to whom and when, never
  message content. Like every server in the network it also keeps a copy of
  every account record: profiles, friend lists, spaces and memberships. See
  [If other people use your server](#if-other-people-use-your-server).

**How the directory shows addresses.** The public listing
(`/v1/servers`) never contains server addresses in plain text, and neither do
the mesh peers a server lists in its `/v1/info` (that endpoint does show the
server's own address, which whoever fetched it already knows). Each appears as
`addr`, encrypted with a key built into the app, padded and with a fresh nonce
every time, next to the server's ID (a hash of its public key). Apps decode it and verify the server's own signature over its
real details, so a directory cannot redirect them. This keeps IPs out of
search engines and casual scraping; it is **not** secret from anyone who
runs the open-source app, and the app necessarily connects to (and so sees)
the servers it measures and uses.

**Recommendations:**

- For friends on your network, the desktop app's server is fine: it accepts
  no connections from the internet unless you forward the port. It still
  connects out to the network to keep its copy of the records.
- For a public server, prefer a small VPS or a separate machine with Docker
  over the computer you use every day, so a compromise doesn't reach your
  files. Keep it updated (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`).
- Only forward the server's ports (TCP+UDP 7443, UDP 7444). Don't put the machine in your
  router's "DMZ".
- If your home IP is sensitive, host on a VPS or behind a reverse proxy
  instead of sharing it.

## If other people use your server

A coordination server holds personal data: the records copied from the
network, the IP addresses of the people connected to it, and, if you turn
them on, mail waiting for offline people and relayed traffic (both
end-to-end encrypted). Whoever runs a server decides to keep that data, so
privacy laws such as the EU's GDPR treat them as responsible for it, as its
_controller_. For your server that is you, not the Crocodile project, just
as the project is for the main server.

What that means depends on who uses your server:

- **Only you, or family and friends you invited.** You probably don't need
  a published notice, but tell the people you invited who runs the server
  and how to reach you. Don't assume the data is private, though: even if
  nobody else connects, your server keeps copies of the records of people
  you don't know, so privacy laws may still apply to you. Look after the
  machine and its disk (see [Hosting safely](#hosting-safely)), and check
  what applies where you live.
- **The public: listed in the directory, or the address shared openly.**
  Publish a privacy notice that says who you are, how to reach you, what the
  server stores and for how long. Start from the
  [privacy notice template](PRIVACY_NOTICE_TEMPLATE.md), which lists what a
  Crocodile server stores. Set the server's contact (`--contact`, or
  _Operator contact_ in the app) to its address or to your email: the app
  shows it to everyone connected to your server, under Settings → Network.
  The desktop app doesn't run a server without a contact.

Whatever the case:

- **Keep only what the server needs.** Its own data directory is all the
  state it keeps. Keep logs short (the main server keeps them for at most 14
  days) and don't add analytics or extra logging of people's addresses.
- **Deletions reach you by themselves.** When someone deletes their account
  in the app, the deletion reaches every server in the network, yours
  included. Your server erases their devices, friends list, memberships and
  waiting mail, and keeps only a "Deleted user" marker (account ID and public
  key) and a "Deleted space" marker for each space they owned, so the account
  can't be brought back.
- **Answer requests.** People may ask what you hold about them, or ask you to
  delete it. Network records are signed by their owners and kept by every
  server, so you can't delete one person's records yourself: a copy you
  delete comes back from the other servers. Point them to account deletion
  in the app, which removes them everywhere. Data only your server has, such
  as its logs, you can delete. Stopping the server and deleting its data
  directory, logs and backups erases everything it holds.

This is not legal advice. The rules differ between countries; if you run a
large public server, check what applies where you live.

## The main server

`deploy/main/` runs the directory and a first coordinator in Docker, behind
the machine's own reverse proxy, which also serves the install scripts and
the website. See
[deploy/main/README.md](../deploy/main/README.md).

## Running a directory

The directory is tiny: `docker compose --profile directory up -d directory`
(port 7400). Point coordinators at it with `CROC_DIRECTORY` and build the app
with `CROC_DIRECTORIES=https://your-directory` to make it the default.
Directories verify that each registered server is reachable at its advertised
URL, and drop servers that stop sending heartbeats.

## Private networks

For a LAN-only or company-internal setup, run a directory with
`CROC_DIR_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` and coordinators with `--private` or private
URLs, or skip the directory entirely: users add the server under
Settings → Connection → Preferred servers.
