A beta release of Crocodile: peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted voice and
text chat. It works, but expect rough edges, and note that it hasn't had an
independent security audit yet.

## Download

| System                  | File                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows (x64 and ARM)   | the `.exe` installer                                                     |
| macOS (Intel and Apple) | the `.dmg` (universal)                                                   |
| Linux                   | `.AppImage`, `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora/openSUSE), `.tar.gz` |

Or install with one line in a terminal, which avoids the warnings below; see
the [README](https://github.com/pwalda/crocodile#install).

These builds are not code-signed yet:

- **Windows:** SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC" → _More info_ →
  _Run anyway_.
- **macOS:** open the app once, then _System Settings → Privacy & Security →
  Open Anyway_. macOS updates are not automatic in unsigned builds; the app
  tells you when a new version is available.

## Getting started

Open Crocodile, pick a name and save your recovery key. The app finds a
coordination server by itself. Add friends under _Home → Add someone_
(`name#1234`), create a space, share the invite, and talk.

Want to run your own server instead, for example on a home network? Turn on
_Settings → Host a server_ and share the address it shows; others add it
under _Settings → Network → Preferred servers_. See the
[self-hosting guide](https://github.com/pwalda/crocodile/blob/main/docs/SELF_HOSTING.md).

## What to try

- Text chat in a space and in DMs; send a DM while your friend is offline and
  see it arrive when they're back.
- Voice rooms with three or more people; leave as the host (the crown / radio
  icon) and check the others stay connected.
- Push-to-talk while another app is focused (Settings → Voice).
- Link a second computer (account menu → _Link another device_).
- Light/dark theme and accent colours (Settings → Appearance).

Found a problem? Open an
[issue](https://github.com/pwalda/crocodile/issues/new/choose) and attach
_Settings → About → Copy diagnostics_ (it contains no messages). Report
