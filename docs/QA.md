# Quality assurance

How Crocodile is tested, and how to test it by hand before a release.

## Layers

| Layer                | What it covers                                                                                                                                    | Where                                              | Runs             |

| Integration tests    | Real coordinators (single and mesh), clients with a fake relay network: chat, DMs, failover, devices, relay grants, outbox, mailbox, abuse limits | `tests/*.test.ts`                                  | every PR         |
| Real-browser E2E     | Chromium WebRTC to the werift host relay with encoded-transform E2EE; Chromium through our TURN server                                            | `tests/browser.test.ts`                            | every PR         |

| Packaging            | Unpacked builds for Windows, macOS, Linux; server bundles and Docker images                                                                       | CI `desktop`, `servers` jobs                       | every PR         |
| Manual QA            | Real networks, real audio, several machines and OSes                                                                                              | this document                                      | before a release |

Coverage is reported on every CI run (job summary and `coverage` artifact).
The thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` are a ratchet: raise them when coverage
grows, never lower them to get a PR green.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm check                 # everything CI's test job runs: typecheck, lint, format, tests
pnpm test                  # tests only (browser tests run when Chromium is available)
pnpm test:coverage         # tests + coverage report in coverage/index.html
pnpm vitest run tests/offline.test.ts -t mailbox   # one file / one test

pnpm qa:env                # local network: directory + 3 meshed coordinators
pnpm qa:app alice bob      # app instances with their own profiles (~/.crocodile-qa/<name>)
pnpm qa:app carol --reset --no-directory   # fresh profile, no server list (first-run path)
xvfb-run -a pnpm qa:smoke /tmp/shots        # the Electron smoke test (Linux; drop xvfb-run on a desktop)
```

`pnpm qa:env` enables the relay and mailbox and allows the relay to reach
loopback addresses (everything runs on one machine). Other machines on your
network can join by adding `http://<your LAN IP>:7443` under Settings →
Network → Preferred servers.

Set `DBG=1` to print client logs in integration tests.

## Writing tests

- A bug fix comes with a test that fails without the fix.
- Protocol, crypto and server behaviour: integration tests in `tests/` with
  real coordinators (`startCoordinator`) and clients (`CrocodileClient` with
  `FakeRelayNetwork`), not mocks of our own code.
- UI flows: extend `tests/electron/smoke.ts`; select elements by role, label
  or visible text (what a user sees), not by CSS classes.
- Timing: wait for conditions (`waitFor`), never fixed sleeps, except to
  prove that something does _not_ happen.
- Never skip, disable or loosen a failing test to get green. A flaky test is
  a bug in the test or the code.

## Manual test matrix (before each release)

Use at least two machines on **different networks** (e.g. home Wi-Fi and a
phone hotspot) and one on the same network. Record results in the release
issue.

| #   | Scenario                                                                                 | Win | macOS | Linux |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | ----- | ----- |
| 1   | Fresh install, first launch, create account, save recovery key                           |     |       |       |
| 2   | Install over the previous version; data and account kept                                 |     |       |       |
| 3   | Add a friend by `name#tag`, accept, DM both ways                                         |     |       |       |
| 4   | DM while the friend is offline; delivered when both are online                           |     |       |       |
| 5   | Same with the mailbox on: delivered while the sender is offline                          |     |       |       |
| 6   | Create a space, invite by link, join from another machine                                |     |       |       |
| 7   | Voice room with 3+ people on different networks; audio both ways                         |     |       |       |
| 8   | Host leaves the room; others keep talking within a few seconds                           |     |       |       |
| 9   | DM call: ring, accept, hang up; decline                                                  |     |       |       |
| 10  | Push-to-talk with another app focused; mouse side button                                 |     |       |       |
| 11  | Mute, deafen, device switching, output volume                                            |     |       |       |
| 12  | Link a second device; messages and spaces appear on both                                 |     |       |       |
| 13  | Remove a device; it stops receiving                                                      |     |       |       |
| 14  | Restore an account from the recovery key                                                 |     |       |       |
| 15  | Host a server from Settings; a friend connects by address                                |     |       |       |
| 16  | Strict network (UDP blocked except the relay): relay opt-in works, 1-hour prompt appears |     |       |       |
| 17  | Laptop sleep / Wi-Fi off and on: reconnects, messages catch up                           |     |       |       |
| 18  | Light/dark theme, accent, compact messages; window resizing                              |     |       |       |
| 19  | Unsigned-build warnings match docs/DISTRIBUTION.md                                       |     |       |       |
| 20  | Update notification / auto-update from the previous release                              |     |       |       |

Useful network conditions to try: two NATs (home + mobile), a VPN, IPv6-only
hotspot, a captive/office network that blocks UDP, and packet loss
(`sudo tc qdisc add dev <if> root netem loss 5% delay 80ms` on Linux).

## Release checklist

1. `main` is green (CI, including the Electron E2E job).
2. Manual matrix above done on the release candidate (an unpublished draft
   release, or a `pnpm dist` build).
3. `docs/releases/<tag>.md` written (what changed, known issues), or rely on
   `docs/releases/default.md`.
4. Publish the release in the GitHub UI (tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main`); watch the
   Release workflow; check every platform's files are attached.
5. Install from the release page on each OS once more (smoke: sign in, send a
   message, join voice).
6. Update the main server (`deploy/main`: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`).

## Bug reports

Testers use the issue form (Bug report). The most useful attachment is
Settings → About → **Copy diagnostics**: versions, connection and session
state and the last 300 client log lines, without message content or keys.
Triage labels: `bug`, area (voice, chat, offline, devices, network,
install), and `release-blocker` for anything in the manual matrix.
